# Real-Time Stock Market Analyzer

The Real-Time Stock Market Analyzer is a comprehensive project designed to provide dynamic analysis of stock market data using various AWS services and technologies.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time stock market analysis system utilizing the following technologies:

- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- Amazon EC2 instances for hosting the application
- Amazon S3 for data storage
- AWS Glue Crawler for data cataloging
- Amazon Athena for interactive query analysis

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Leveraging Apache Kafka, the system ensures seamless and timely data streaming, allowing for up-to-the-minute analysis of stock market data.

- **Scalable Cloud Architecture:** By utilizing Amazon EC2 instances, the project harnesses the power of cloud computing to ensure scalability and high availability.

- **Data Cataloging:** AWS Glue Crawler is employed to automatically catalog and organize the stock market data, enabling efficient querying and analysis.

- **Interactive Analysis:** Amazon Athena provides a user-friendly interface for executing SQL-like queries on the data, facilitating interactive and ad-hoc analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up an Apache Kafka cluster and configure the necessary topics for data streaming.
3. Launch Amazon EC2 instances and deploy the project codebase.
4. Configure Amazon S3 buckets to store data and results.
5. Utilize AWS Glue Crawler to catalog the data stored in S3.
6. Use Amazon Athena to execute queries and gain insights from the data.

## Usage

- Ensure all necessary configurations are set before running the application.
- Start the data streaming process using the Apache Kafka cluster.
- The application will process the data in real-time and store results in the configured S3 buckets.
- Access Amazon Athena to perform queries and analysis on the processed data.
